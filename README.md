# Fast Food Sankey Explorer

## Overview
I built this project to explore and visualize patterns in fast food nutrition data through an interactive dashboard, combining my interest in data visualization with my own health journey after losing 70 pounds. Instead of relying on static charts, this tool lets users dynamically filter menu items and see how restaurants, calorie ranges, and fat content relate to each other.

The focus of this project is **interactive data exploration and visualization design**, rather than producing a single fixed result.

## What This Does
Given a fast food nutrition dataset, the system:

- Filters menu items by restaurant
- Applies a maximum fat threshold
- Buckets items into calorie ranges
- Visualizes relationships using a Sankey diagram
- Allows users to interactively explore the data through a web dashboard

The Sankey diagram highlights how menu items flow from restaurants into different calorie categories, weighted by fat content. It compares calorie distributions across restaurants, using the selected restaurant to define the calorie ranges shown. The fat slider filters out menu items above a chosen fat threshold, allowing users to focus on lower-fat options.

## How It’s Built
The project is organized into a few core components:

- **`fast_api.py`** — loads data, performs filtering, and prepares networks for visualization  
- **`sankey2.py`** — reusable helper functions for building Sankey diagrams with Plotly  
- **`fastexplorer.py`** — Panel-based dashboard that connects widgets, tables, and the visualization  
- **`data/fastfood.csv`** — nutritional dataset used for analysis  

The dashboard is served locally and updates dynamically as users change inputs.

## Technical Concepts
This project touches a mix of data science and visualization concepts, including:

- Interactive data visualization
- Network-style (Sankey) diagrams
- Data binning and aggregation
- Dashboard development with Panel
- Modular Python design
- Separation of data processing and presentation logic

## Results & Demo

Below is an example Sankey diagram generated by the application:

This visualization shows how menu items from a selected restaurant distribute across calorie ranges, with flow thickness representing fat content.

*(For full interactivity you can run the dashboard locally.)*
